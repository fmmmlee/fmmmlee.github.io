            This project was born largely out of my own curiosity about courses offered at my university. The tool currently in place, Classfinder (with an e), is functional, if not particularly pretty, but I wanted to know things about the courses that were less-than-useful but still interesting. Things like “how many courses are in the communications building?” or “how were Honors courses distributed around campus in the years before the Honors Center was created?” I decided that the natural thing to do would be to have my own database mirroring the university’s, which I could then write tools for and query in ways that the official tool didn’t offer. More information as well as the current status of the tool can be found on the <a href="https://github.com/fmmmlee/Classfindr" style="color: white;">Github</a>.

                This was the first collaborative dev experience I had outside of the classroom, and also my first hackathon. I was paired with a freshman (I was a Junior at the time, but only in my first year at Western), and we decided on a fairly simple task: Connect to the <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha Vantage</a> API and print various financial data to the console when the user requested it. Nothing fancy, but we felt that it was a good match for our skill level (and our desire for sleep during the 24-hour contest). My partner decided to handle the console user interface, while I worked on making API calls and parsing the JSON files returned. I learned a lot about working alongside another developer, as well as the lesson to select a library very carefully and map out the features it needs to have before implementing it, particularly when working on a schedule. For an extended and mostly coherent account of my hackathon experience (written after the deadline on a scant few hours of sleep), <a href="hackathon_experience.pdf">click here</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/fmmmlee/Hackathon2019">visit the Github</a> to see the finished product.
