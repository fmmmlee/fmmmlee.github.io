            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Matthew! I'm a graduate student at Western Washington University. I really enjoy developing things both for school and in my free time, as I'm driven by the reward of a functioning build or completed project as well as the satisfaction of learning new things. I find myself constantly jotting down notes about interesting project opportunities, ranging from those that would efficiently perform a task for me to others that might help me explore a concept that I want to understand further. </p>
            <p>In addition to the never-ending list of subjects from computer science that interest me, I also enjoy learning about collaborative work, the interview process, and improving productivity. Outside the scope of work and the industry, I love reading, writing, gaming, and Kpop.
            </p>

                    In 2015, Mt. Baker in Washington State. I did not bring or wear sunscreen, which was a terrible mistake. <!--If you ever climb a snow-capped mountain, wear sunscreen (on your face/neck) like you're about to spend the day sunbathing on the Mexican Riviera. You will need it.-->
                    Then in 2019, pre-pandemic, Mt. Fuji in Japan.

                    I'm pretty sure I can count on one hand the occasions when I've drunk alcohol. I can only remember three, all before turning 21 --- a couple sips of rice wine in China (wasn't a big fan), a sip of some kind of red wine in Argentina (again, not a fan), and half a dram of scotch at a whisky distillery in Scotland (it burned, but I could see the appeal).

                    Ok, so here's the full story of the SAT one. I left it out because after writing it, it both didn't fit the page formatting and also sounded like a huge humblebrag.
                    I chose to leave it as a comment since I thought I might tell the story in a blog post or something later and didn't want to rewrite it.
                    Plus, if you're reading the page source of my personal website, though, I figure you won't mind the humblebrag as much, so I can add some context.

                    
                    <dt>I had to take the SAT when I was 12...because my brother wanted to take it when <i>he</i> was 12.</dt>
                <dd>My brother was very competitive and a high achiever. I'm not sure how he found out about it, but there was a program at Johns Hopkins University called the Study of Exceptional Talent, and he set his sights on getting in. The criteria was achieving a certain score on the SAT (700 in either Math or Critical Reading), so he wanted to take it and send in his scores. Apparently it took much cajoling on his part, but our parents relented and he took the test and got in.
                    
                By the time I was the same age 2 years later, it was pretty much expected that I would take the SAT for the same reason. I did, and I got into the SET, but I've always thought it was funny that my brother had to convince my parents to <i>let</i> him take the test, but I would've had to convince them to let me <i>not</i> take it had I not wanted to.
                
                Also, as of this writing (Sept. 2021), the college board recently stopped allowing test takers under 13, I believe, so the SET is for the time being not accepting applicants 12 or under.
            </dd>
                Additional context - I definitely wouldn't include the below in the fun fact.
                If you're curious, my score at 12 was 750 in critical reading, low to mid 600s in Math, and around 580 in writing because my essay was...bad. Literally the lowest awardable score, if I recall correctly.
                Funnily enough, when I took it again after the rework in 2016, because I wanted to apply to college, I got 740 in critical reading. Lower than my 12-year-old self. Ouch.
                I chalked that up (and still do) to my altered entertainment diet, mostly the internet at age 16/17 instead of practically purely books at 12, few of which were written at appropriate grade level.
            
                I comported myself rather better in Math, scoring a 790, and there is no writing or essay section on the new SAT. Got a good score on the GRE essay, though! (5.0, or 93rd percentile)
