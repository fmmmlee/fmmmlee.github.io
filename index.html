            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm a perpetually curious student and developer in my Senior year of university. Driven by the intrinsic reward of seeing a functioning build or completed project as well as the satisfaction of learning new things, I find myself constantly jotting down notes about interesting project opportunities, ranging from those that would efficiently perform a task for me to others that might help me explore a concept that I want to understand further. </p>
            <p>In addition to the never-ending list of subjects from computer science that interest me (see below for some of my favorites), I also enjoy learning about collaborative work, the interview process, and improving productivity. Outside the scope of work and the industry, I love reading, writing, gaming, and music.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <h3>Languages</h3>
            Ranked most to least proficient:
            <br/>
            <p>
                <b>Java and C</b> - Comfortable working with these and writing programs that utilize their varied toolsets and abilities. There's always more to learn, but these languages are familiar faces by now.
                <br/>
                <b>C++, CUDA, and OpenCL</b> - Can develop applications with these, but there is a bit more documentation-checking involved than I'd like.
                <br/>
                <b>HTML and CSS</b> - Just good enough to write this website; interesting, but not my forte or my focus.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <h3>Concurrency and Parallelism</h3>
            <p>The idea of being able to perform a task more efficiently by somehow dividing up the workload has always held a strong appeal for me, and since taking my first steps into implementing concurrency, it's become one of my favorite ways to improve runtime. Implementing it often proves difficult on multiple levels, providing the kind of challenges that I excel at. I also appreciate that it presents opportunities for making different design decisions, from leaning into the massively parallelized architecture of a GPU, with its unique strengths and weaknesses, to rebuilding a data-processing function from the ground up to stream individual objects so they can be handled by different cores or processors.</p>
            <h3>Algorithm Optimization</h3>
            <p>Just like concurrency and parallelism, algorithm optimization provides the ability to make a program run more efficiently, and that's why I enjoy it. Perhaps there's a bottleneck that could be removed, or maybe a program makes unnecessary passes over a data set. When dealing with algorithms, there are infinite possibilities that can be explored, particularly as complexity increases, so problems can stay varied and feel fresh even after encountering hundreds of them.</p>
            <h3>Big Data</h3>
            <p>I like the idea of Big Data for one reason: Any improvement made is magnified astronomically by the scale of the task. Thus, even mathematically small tweaks to efficiency or runtime can become worth chasing down thanks to their effect being upscaled to become practically significant. That means more opportunities for interesting problems to solve and discoveries to be made!</p>
