            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hi, I'm Matthew! I'm a student and developer in my Senior year of university. I really enjoy developing things both for school and in my free time, as I'm driven by the reward of a functioning build or completed project as well as the satisfaction of learning new things. I find myself constantly jotting down notes about interesting project opportunities, ranging from those that would efficiently perform a task for me to others that might help me explore a concept that I want to understand further. </p>
            <p>In addition to the never-ending list of subjects from computer science that interest me (see below for some of my favorites), I also enjoy learning about collaborative work, the interview process, and improving productivity. Outside the scope of work and the industry, I love reading, writing, gaming, and Kpop.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <h3>Languages</h3>
            Ranked most to least proficient:
            <br/>
            <p>
                <b>Java, C# and C</b> - I'm comfortable developing in these languages and writing programs that utilize their varied toolsets and abilities. There's always more to learn, but these languages are familiar faces by now.
                <br/>
                <b>C++</b> - I can work with this thanks to my experience in C, but I'll definitely have a browser tab (or three) open with documentation as I code.
                <br/>
                <b>HTML and CSS</b> - Just good enough to write this website!
            </p>
            
            I'm also somewhat proficient in scripting - I typically use Powershell for my own personal time-saving purposes (since I'm a Windows user) and Bash for use in research or running on my VM/Docker containers.
            
            <br/>
            <h1>Interests</h1>
            <h3>Concurrency and Parallelism</h3>
            <p>The idea of being able to perform a task more efficiently by somehow dividing up the workload has always held a strong appeal for me, and since first tentatively exploring concurrency in a project or two, it's become one of my favorite ways to improve runtime. Implementing it often proves difficult on multiple levels, providing unique challenges that keep me on my toes. I also appreciate that it presents opportunities for making different design decisions, from leaning into the massively parallelized architecture of a GPU, with its unique strengths and weaknesses, to completely rewriting a data-processing function to allow for pipelining individual objects so they can be handled by different cores or processors.</p>
            <h3>Algorithm Optimization</h3>
            <p>Just like concurrency and parallelism, algorithm optimization provides the ability to make a program run more efficiently, and that's why I enjoy it. Perhaps there's a bottleneck that could be removed, or maybe a program makes unnecessary passes over a data set. When dealing with algorithms, there are infinite possibilities that can be explored, particularly as the problem's complexity increases, so problems can stay varied and feel fresh even after encountering hundreds of them.</p>
            <h3>UX and Design</h3>
            <p>I've always appreciated intuitive and beautifully-designed applications, so once I started to get opportunities to try my own hand at application development, I found that designing programs to meet those qualifications is even more gratifying than using them! There's a certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i> about hitting "debug" and having an easy to use, pleasing to the eye, and intuitive to navigate program appear in front of me, the product of too many late nights either spent in front of a monitor or in bed sleeplessly staring through the ceiling. It combines the satisfaction of making something beautiful with that of making something that <i>works</i>, and that makes the countless hours poured into both back and front-end design worth it.</p>
            <h3>Documentation</h3>
            <p>It seems that I never got the memo that I'm supposed to hate writing documentation; I think it can be pretty fun! Everyone I've talked to, be they students or industry professionals, has expressed that documentation is something that they prefer to avoid in favor of writing code. I find it to be a good opportunity to slow myself down and make sure my understanding of the code is rock-solid while helping other developers solidify their own understanding as well. Knowing my way around a project just well enough to push code and close one ticket is fine, but I find that when I have the ability to explain what is going on to someone who's never seen it before, I end up making more meaningful and maintainable commits to the project --- and hopefully the documentation I write helps others do the same.
